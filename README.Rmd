[![Project Status: WIP ? Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This package is designed to make it easy for R users to work through the R track on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

It is not a complete replacement for the [Exercism CLI](http://exercism.io/clients/cli), but instead provides easy access to the most commonly used CLI functionality:

- [x] fetch problems
- [x] skip problems
- [ ] submit solutions
- [ ] check status/progress
- [ ] fetch previous submissions

## Install

```
devtools::install_github("jonmcalder/exercism")
library(exercism)
```

## Setup

#### Set your API key

Go to [exercism.io -> account -> API key](http://exercism.io/account/key)

<img src="man/figures/api_key.png" />

Copy your API key (highlighted above in orange), and then run:

```
set_api_key("<your API key>")
```

#### Set exercism path
```
set_exercism_path("<path_to_your_exercism_directory>")
```

Once you've set your API key and exercism path these will be remembered for future R sessions.

## Usage

Get the next problem for the R track:

```
fetch_next()
```

Get a specific problem for the R track (e.g. "leap"):

```
fetch_problem(slug = "leap")
```

Skip a specific problem for the R track (e.g. "bob"):

```
skip_problem(slug = "bob")
```

(note that you may specify a different language track via the `track_id` argument)

## RStudio Addin

The core functionality mentioned above is also accessible via an RStudio Addin. 
You can access it via the Addins menu, or by running `exercism_addin()`.
