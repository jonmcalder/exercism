This package is designed to make it easy for R users to work through the R track on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

It is not a complete replacement for the [Exercism CLI](http://exercism.io/clients/cli), but instead provides easy access to the most commonly used CLI functionality:

- fetch problems
- skip problems
- submit solutions (not implemented yet)
- check status/progress (not implemented yet)
- fetch previous submissions (not implemented yet)

## Install `exercism`

```
devtools::install_github("jonmcalder/exercism")
```

## RStudio gadget (not implemented yet)

The above mentioned (core) package functionality is also accessible via an RStudio gadget.
